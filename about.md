Hi! I'm Dane, a software developer for an adaptive optics company. I get to work on really neat projects with a huge variety of really smart people.

Professionally, I do most of my work in C++ on Windows. Visual Studio is where I spend most of my time at work. I also work with LabVIEW occasionally.

Personally, I write in a lot of languages. Java is my main go-to language, but I also write C#, Python and C++ for projects. I love working on projects involving embedded systems and electronics.

I also volunteer for FIRST Robotics and Team 1619. I teach high school students how to program in a challenging sporting environment. It is by far one of the most fulfilling things I have ever done.
