Hi! I'm Dane, a software engineer and a maker.

I work for Charter Communications. I have experience developing C# and C++ desktop and server software for Windows, particularly software interacting with add-in hardware and data acquisition. I also have experience writing Python, Matlab and LabVIEW.

I'm a maker and some of my favorite hobbies include woodworking, 3D printing, and electronics. Building something neat is super satisfying and I hope to someday have a nice home shop to foster this creativity.

I also volunteer for FIRST Robotics and Team 1619. I teach high school students how to program and build robots. It is by far one of the most fulfilling things I have ever done.
